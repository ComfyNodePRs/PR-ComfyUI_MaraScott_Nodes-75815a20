This is a revised version of the Bus node from the [Was Node Suite](https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui) to integrate more input/output.

If anybody is interested to use it, I'm following on feature request.

Roadmap
[x] Extend original Bus Node Input/Output with Latent, Image & Mask
[ ] Add Menu Item to extend the number of Input/Output for the Bus
[ ] Implement Get/Set system
[ ] Implement Bus Profiling (Default, Pipe, ...)
